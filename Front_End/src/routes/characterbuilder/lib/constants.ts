Adventurers are invaluable in diverse situations, thriving on their resourcefulness and ability to tackle a wide variety of challenges.",

Their exceptional strength allows them to wield heavy weapons and don thick armor without being slowed, making them resilient and powerful on the battlefield. Specializing in physical combat, warriors excel in close-quarters engagements, where their brute force and endurance make them unstoppable forces against any foe. While a warrior can learn to cast magic with enough training, it doesn't come easily.",
  wizard:
    'Wizards are highly intelligent casters, mastering various schools of magic with unparalleled skill. While their magical prowess is immense, their physical frailty makes them vulnerable in combat. Struggling to wear even medium armor, wizards must avoid direct confrontation, as they can fall quickly if targeted. However, their mystical support or devastating spells can turn the tide of battle when used strategically.',
  thief:
    'Thieves are swift and nimble fighters, adept at wearing medium armor while relying on their agility to evade attacks rather than absorb them. Masters of stealth and precision, they prefer to strike quickly and decisively, catching enemies off-guard. Whether in close combat with blades or at range with throwing daggers, thieves excel at delivering lethal damage from unexpected angles. Their speed and cunning allow them to outmaneuver foes, making them deadly when they strike and elusive when pursued.'
