- Breadcrumbs?
- tags?
- Guides -> 'Adventure Guides' doesn't seem to fit well
- Guides -> When on a specific guide, the sidebar 'guide' doesn't light up active
- Guides -> Slug -> Typing on the image component in portable text is a mess. Worked perfectly without using $props and having 'export let portableText', might be due to svelte 5 version mismatch.
